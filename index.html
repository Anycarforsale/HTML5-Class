				  <dt>Week 1 - Introduction and Setup</dt>
				  <dd>This week was an overview of the class reviewing the syllabus.</dd>
				  <dt>Week 2 - HTML, CSS,& The DOM.</dt>
				  <dd>This weeks assignment was to create a basic HTML document and use CSS to style the elements.  I decided develop this Homework submission page further. As well as start plugging away at a <a href="http://www.markbreneman.com/">personal portfolio site</a></dd>
				  <dt>Week 3 - CSS3!</dt>
				  <dd>Week 3's assignment was to start a new page or build upon last week’s by adding a pseudo class and one or more of the new styles we learned about. Many of the styles we discuss I already used in creating this page in week two so I took some time to refine little bit of the  <a href="http://www.markbreneman.com/personalportfolioprojects/WWMD.html"> project page </a>of my personal portfolio. I added the fwd and back buttons to the slide show, added some rounded corners and some gradients around the content.				  
				  </dd>
				  <dt>Week 4 - Animations!</dt>
				  <dd>This week I started playing around with trying to animate the movement of the letter blocks<a href="www.itp.nyu.edu/~mbb395/HTML5-Spring2012/Week4/WheelofFortune.html">on the old wheel of fortune.</a> I used transition to time the transform operation and changed the opacity of the letters using animation.  The phrase is hat-tip to this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2XymdmLQhE">video</a></dd>
				  <dt>Week 5 - JavaScript.</dt>
				  <dd> I continued playing around this week with the wheel of fortune self potato site.  This week used javascript to add the photo of the contestant, and  guess button to remove the class on all the letters setting them to "flipped" state. <a href="http://www.itp.nyu.edu/~mbb395/HTML5-Spring2012/Week5/WheelofFortune.html"> Week5 WheelofFortune</a> </dd>

				  <dt>Week 6 - Audio/Video/Notifications!</dt>
				  <dd>  This Weeks assignment got mixed into the midterm. Check week7!</dd>
				  <dt>Week 7 - MidTerm</dt>
				  <dd>So for the midterm I expanded on the wheel of fortune page.  I added a spinning wheel element using canvas, elements, made the letters 3D cubes, added a theme intro, and a guess button which on a javascript listener reveals the guessed letters. <a href="http://www.itp.nyu.edu/~mbb395/HTML5-Spring2012/Week6/WheelofFortune.html"> Week7 WheelofFortune</a> </dd>
				  <dt>Week 8 - AJAX/JSON/Browser History!</dt>
				  <dd>This week we learned about AJAX and JSON and it really felt like we blew open the door to doing more with the browser. Although probably more difficult than previous weeks assignment, it really started to illuminate the backend to frontend relationship through JSON.  For this weeks assignment, I figured I'd start working with a longer term train station sign project in mind.  I created two "signs" which are links, that when the user clicks calls twitter and pulls back the links as search terms. <a href="http://www.itp.nyu.edu/~mbb395/HTML5-Spring2012/Week8/StatusBoard.html"> Week8 Statusboard</a></dd>
				  <dt>Week 9 - Local Storage/Geolocation.</dt>
				  <dd>Continuing on our API jaunt from last week, we dove further into some of the HTML 5 browser enhancements looking at Local Storage and Geolocation.  This week I took data from the MTA(horrible API!) and made a quick navigation app, using the current position of the user to locate the closest MTA Train Stops.  Links are then generated for a google maps directions to the station choice desired.<a href="http://www.itp.nyu.edu/~mbb395/HTML5-Spring2012/Week9/StatusBoard.html"> Week9 Statusboard Part2</a></dd>
				  <dt>Week 10 - Canvas!</dt>
				  <dd>For Week 10 our task was to experiment with Canvas.  I spent a little time on the midterm using a canvas element on the wheel of fortune wheel. This week I continued with the status board train theme and built a swiss railway clock in canvas.  I'm going to try and start stitching all of it together potentially for a final project.<a href="http://www.itp.nyu.edu/~mbb395/HTML5-Spring2012/Week10/StatusBoard.html">Week 10 Swiss Rail Clock</a></dd>
				  <dt>Week 11 - Files:Drag and Drop.</dt>
				  <dd> For Week 11 we were working on files uploading and drag and drop. I took a break from all the train status work this week and worked on deploying an app to heroku, which used the file uploader.<a href="http://postcardsfromthenow.heroku.com/">Postcards from the Now</a> </dd>
				  <dt>Week 12 - Mobile!</dt>
				  <dd>Mobile…the final frontier…this week we took it easy and just surveyed some of the new mobile tags for HTML5.  No homework.</dd>
				  <dt>Week 13 - Finals WorkShop</dt>
				  <dd>For this </dd>
				  <dt>Week 14 - FINALS</dt>
